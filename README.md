This paper explores the TCP/IP protocol suite, focusing on TCP's three-way handshake that establishes a reliable connection. The handshake—SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK—synchronizes devices for data transfer. Understanding this process and TCP/IP’s layered structure is essential for analyzing network communication and reliability.
